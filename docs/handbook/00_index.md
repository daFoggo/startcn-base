# startcn-base Handbook

This folder is the canonical documentation set for the reusable base frontend architecture and development rules.

> Docs are written in **SKILL.md format** — each has a `name`/`description` frontmatter so agents can load the matching section as a playbook. Reference docs (`01`, `02`, `10`, ...) stay prose.
>
> This handbook documents **generic, reusable standards**. Project-specific content (a particular brand, page archetypes for one site, visual references) lives outside the base in `docs/project/`.

## Mandatory Agent Rule Files

Automation agents and coding assistants should read `AGENTS.md` at the project root first, which points directly to this handbook.

## Core Decisions

- Feature modules own feature-local code; routes own cross-feature page composition.
- Feature components receive cross-feature data and actions through props/callbacks; routes or layout containers own those dependencies.
- `server.ts` is server-only and never exported from feature barrels.
- Query functions return valid data or throw. Failed queries are not empty states.
- Route loaders decide criticality: `queryClient.query()` awaited blocks, fire-and-forget warms cache.
- Critical data uses Suspense and route error boundaries.
- Optional widgets use local `useQuery` states.
- Supabase client access is centralized in `src/utils/supabase.ts`.
- Auth and data mutations use the Supabase JS client, not a hand-rolled HTTP client.
- Zustand is for synchronous client/transient UI state only; do not mirror server state in Zustand.
- Always use atomic selectors or `useShallow` with Zustand stores to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- UI state handling is mandatory for every async UI surface.
- Compact UI is allowed only when full `Alert` or empty state would break layout flow.
- Submit-critical dependency queries must block actions while loading or errored.
