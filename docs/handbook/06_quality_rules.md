# Quality Rules

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing any UI code.
- Deciding whether to hand-roll a tag or use a primitive.
- Before finishing multi-file work (run the checks).

## Checks

Run these after larger changes or before merging:

```bash
pnpm exec biome check --write
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

Do not run expensive checks repeatedly for every tiny edit unless requested.

## Code Safety

- Do not use non-null assertions (`!`) to bypass types.
- Use guard clauses, optional chaining, and safe fallbacks.
- Custom `<button>` elements need explicit `type`.
- Do not use `window.confirm()`; use `AlertDialog`.
- Do not remove focus rings.
- Do not introduce hidden runtime assumptions for route params or query data.

## Styling Rules

Canonical token rules live in `10_design_tokens.md`. Summary:

- **Nghiêm cấm arbitrary custom values (`className-[...]`)**: tuyệt đối không dùng `w-[460px]`, `max-w-[400px]`, `text-[10px]`, `text-[11px]`, `p-[15px]`, `gap-[10px]`, `min-h-[500px]`, `z-[999]`.
- Dùng **semantic theme tokens** (`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `bg-background`, `border-border`...) — không dùng màu raw (`#fff`, `rgb(...)`, `bg-[#...]`) và không dùng palette Tailwind gốc (`bg-zinc-900`, `text-zinc-300`) khi token tương đương đã tồn tại. Bất kỳ surface luôn-tối nào cũng dùng `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` (xem `10_design_tokens.md`).
- Chỉ dùng Tailwind default scale: font `text-xs`..`text-9xl` (tối thiểu `text-xs`), spacing 4px, `gap-*` thay cho `space-*`, `size-*` khi w = h.
- Không hardcode z-index.
- Chỉ dùng một thư viện icon duy nhất của project (`@tabler/icons-react` trong repo này).
- Không dùng `<Badge>` cho filter vì badge không có interactive state.

## Component Rules

- Prefer existing `@/components/ui` and `@/components/common` components.
- Place components by scope of reuse + domain coupling (`02_architecture.md` → Component Placement Rule): page-local views go in `routes/<area>/-components/`, cross-page feature views in `features/[f]/components/`, domain-agnostic app-wide UI in `components/common`. Promote a route-local component into a feature when it gains a second consumer.
- Add a new component only when existing components cannot be composed cleanly.
- Add `data-slot` only when the root will actually be targeted from outside the component: CSS selectors (`[data-slot="..."]`, `has-data-[slot=...]`, `in-data-[slot=...]`), or JS (`querySelector`/scroll-spy). Do not add it speculatively to every component — a `data-slot` that nothing references is dead weight. shadcn `@/components/ui` primitives already carry their own `data-slot`; leave those untouched.
- Components with two or more variants should use CVA.
- Icon-only buttons need `aria-label` or screen-reader text.
- Inputs must support default, focus, error, disabled, and readonly states.
- Use `aria-invalid` for error states.

### Primitive Usage (Buttons, Inputs, Controls)

**Mindset rule:** before writing a raw `<button>`, `<a>`, styled `<div>`, or `animate-pulse` markup, ask "does a component already exist for this?" If yes, use it. Hand-rolling a tag + classes when a primitive exists is the primary source of UI inconsistency. Choose the primitive, then pick its `variant` / `size` / type props to express intent — do not re-implement the component's built-in appearance.

- Do not restyle a default `Button` by overriding its radius (`rounded-full`), font size/weight (`text-xs`, `font-medium`), or padding (`px-4`). The primitive's default IS the design system. `<Button>Label</Button>` and `<Button variant="outline">Label</Button>` should be the norm.
- `className` on a primitive is only for:
  - **Layout** overrides: `w-full`, `mt-2`, `gap-2`, alignment.
  - **Theme-necessitated** overrides: colors that must stay constant across light/dark (e.g. a white CTA on an always-dark marketing card). Prefer reusing existing tokens (`bg-white`, `text-zinc-950`) over re-styling shape/typography.
- Do not hand-roll a styled `<button>` pill for search, language, or icon controls. Compose existing primitives instead:
  - Search field → `InputGroup` + `InputGroupInput` + `InputGroupAddon`/`InputGroupButton`.
  - Language / menu trigger → `DropdownMenuTrigger` with `render={<Button variant="outline" />}`.
  - Icon-only control → `Button variant="ghost" size="icon-sm"`.
- Internal navigation must not use a raw `<a>` as a button. Use `Button render={<Link to="..." />} nativeButton={false}` (TanStack Router `Link`). External links keep a real `<a>`.
- Custom `<button>` elements are allowed only for genuinely bespoke controls that primitives cannot express; they still need explicit `type`, focus styles, and `aria-label`.

### Compound Component Rules (Vercel Composition, Minimal)

Compound components (`Object.assign(Comp, { SubComp })`) are only justified when callers genuinely compose the sub-parts in more than one way (e.g. `AppNavbar.Root/.Brand/.Nav/.Actions`, `HomeHero.Root/.Title/.Row/.Description`).

- Do NOT create a `Root`/`Header`/`Card`/`Item`/`Preset` compound for a section that is only ever rendered as one unit. Export a single component instead.
- Keep large internal visual blocks as private (non-exported) helper functions in the same file when that improves readability.
- Do not thread `className` + `...props` through internal wrappers that never receive them. Props exist only when a caller actually passes them.
- Do not export a `Preset` that duplicates the component itself.
- Reassess a compound component when its sub-parts stop being used in composition; collapse it back to a single component.

## Motion Rules

- Animate transform, opacity, and color.
- Do not animate width, height, or padding.
- Respect reduced motion with `motion-safe:` and `motion-reduce:`.
- Use existing Tailwind/tw-animate-css utilities before adding custom keyframes.

## Review Rules

When reviewing code, prioritize:

1. Runtime bugs and user-visible regressions.
2. Query/data correctness.
3. Error handling and SSR safety.
4. Missing loading/error/empty states.
5. Cache invalidation and mutation side effects.
6. Accessibility and design-system violations.
7. Test or verification gaps.
8. **Encoding integrity** — scan source files for mojibake (`â€¦`, `â€”`, `Ã©`, `báº±ng`, …) after any shell/batch edit. Corrupted UTF-8 silently breaks UI copy and comments. Fix with the edit tool, never with `Set-Content`/`Out-File` in PowerShell (they re-encode by default).

## Documentation Rules

- Update handbook docs when a repeated pattern or project-wide rule changes.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` as an entry point, not as the full detailed manual.
